========================

LocalWiki is a grassroots effort to collect, share and open the world's local knowledge.

**To edit LocalWiki or to bring LocalWiki to your community, please visit https://localwiki.org.**

For information on the LocalWiki API, please see https://localwiki.org/api.

This is a *meta* repository, used to plan across *the entire LocalWiki project*.  We use this repository to plan events, plan blog posts, figure out who should do what, etc.

To report an issue, a bug, a feature, a dream, a poem, a plan, or a whim, please see..

`the issue tracker! <https://github.com/localwiki/localwiki/issues>`_
===========================================================================


**How does this work?**

You can report, dream, scheme anything here!  LocalWiki volunteers will move your issue to other repositories if necessary.  In particular, feature requests and proposals that haven't yet had a chance for community input are left here, as well as UI discussion and debate.  This repository is also used for all of our other planning.
